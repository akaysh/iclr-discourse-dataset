# ICLR Discourse Dataset

You will need to have downloaded [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) and set `$CORENLP_HOME` to point to the unzipped directory.

To set up the environment and build the dataset, run

```
bash setup.sh
```

This step takes about 30 minutes, and should produce dataset files in the directory `review_classification`.
